            Barriers To Takedown 
        </h2>
        

    </header>
    <p>
      The main barriers to taking your opponent down is what stops you from getting to his legs 
      with your hands. This includes his head, hands and elbows. 
    </p>
    <!-- Main Container -->
    <div id="container">
    
    

        <!-- An aside -->
        <!-- This is for holding the 3D object -->
        <div id="aSide">

            <!-- 3D objsect -->
            <!-- This inserts the 3D object inside the aside container -->
            <model-viewer src="assets/barriers_to_takedown.glb" alt="VR Headset" auto-rotate camera-controls ar ios-src="assets/barriers_to_takedown">
            </model-viewer>
        </div>

    <p>
        There are three ways to get around these barriers. The first is to get your partner's 
        hands on the mat, so that they are occupied with keeping their balance and not defending
        your takedown. 
    </p>
    <div id="aSide">

        <!-- 3D objsect -->
        <!-- This inserts the 3D object inside the aside container -->
        <model-viewer src="assets/hands_on_mat.glb" alt="VR Headset" auto-rotate camera-controls ar ios-src="assets/hands_on_mat">
        </model-viewer>
    </div>

    <p>
       The second way, to beat your training partner's elbows, is to get outside them. 
    </p>
    <div id="aSide">

        <!-- 3D objsect -->
        <!-- This inserts the 3D object inside the aside container -->
        <model-viewer src="assets/outside_elbows.glb" alt="VR Headset" auto-rotate camera-controls ar ios-src="assets/outside_elbows">
        </model-viewer>
    </div>
    <p>
        The third way, to beat your training partner's head, is to get them to raise their 
        posture, thus opening up a path into their legs which you can do with a level-change. 
     <div id="aSide">
 
         <!-- 3D objsect -->
         <!-- This inserts the 3D object inside the aside container -->
         <model-viewer src="assets/beat_the_head.glb" alt="VR Headset" auto-rotate camera-controls ar ios-src="assets/beat_the_head">
         </model-viewer>
     </div>
