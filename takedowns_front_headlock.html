    <p>
        Takedowns that come out of the front head lock position are a great place to start your study. This is because getting
        to this position solves a lot of the problems of takedowns. You are already close to your partner, so there is no need 
        to cover distance. There is no need to level change as you are already down by your training partner's legs due to the 
        nature of the position. As your training partner's head is low and stance is compromised, he cannot sprawl effectively 
        to defend your takedowns. You may employ takedowns such as the ankle pick straight out of front head lock, or you may 
        use it as an easy entry into effective leg-based takedowns, such as the double-leg.
