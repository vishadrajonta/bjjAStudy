            Keeping Good Defensive Stance

    <p>
        It is vitally important to keep a good defensive stance at all times. This includes 
        matching your head level and angle to your training partners', so that you protect
        yourself from level changes and flanking attacks. It also involves tucking in your neck, 
        so that your training partner finds it difficult to get collar ties and to get your hands 
        to the mat. This is best done by shrugging your shoulders, which in turn is best done when 
        your elbows are close to your body. You want your hands and elbows low so that you can block
        your opponent's shot into your legs if he does indeed beat your head.
